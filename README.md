# cad4vlsi-project

## Project Description
This project is a part of the course CAD for VLSI Design. This project implements the Quine-McCluskey algorithm for minimization of boolean functions and utilizes petrick's minimization algorithm to find the minimal solution. The project is implemented in Python.

## Notes
- Since Petrick's method is used to find the minimal solution, the output may vary between runs if two solutions are equally optimal. For example, the test: test_quine_mccluskeyB4 will have two possible minimal solutions.
